#  Design of Single-Stage Differential Amplifier 

In this project, I designed and simulated a single-stage differential amplifier using 90nm CMOS technology in Cadence Virtuoso, an industry-standard tool for analog and mixed-signal (AMS) design. The main objective was to build a compact, efficient analog amplifier that could meet specific performance needs and be integrated into mixed-signal systems. The amplifier was tailored to operate within an **input common-mode range (ICMR) of 0.8V to 1.6V, achieving a voltage gain of approximately 40dB and a gain-bandwidth product (GBW) of 5MHz**.

### Key steps in the design process included:
  - Proper biasing circuit design
  - Transistor sizing for performance optimization
  - DC operating point analysis
  - AC and frequency response simulations

The final design proved that a well-optimized single-stage differential amplifier can offer strong performance even with a simple topology. It’s a solid choice for applications like analog front-ends, where area, power, and speed must all be considered.

### ✅ Simulation Results:
  - Voltage Gain: 39.83 dB
  - Gain-Bandwidth Product (GBW): 4.8 MHz
  - ICMR: 0.8V to 1.6V
